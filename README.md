# Student-Grade-Tracker
A simple JavaScript mini project that helps track students’ marks, calculate their average, and assign grades automatically. This project demonstrates the use of arrays, objects, and functions in JavaScript.


✨ Features

✔️ Add multiple students with subject-wise marks
✔️ Automatically calculate the average score
✔️ Assign grades based on average marks
✔️ Display a detailed student report

| Concept          | Usage                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Arrays**       | To store list of students                                              |
| **Objects**      | To store student details `{ name, marks }`                             |
| **Functions**    | `addStudents()`, `avgCalculation()`, `gradeCalculation()`, `display()` |
| **Loops**        | Iterating over students & subjects                                     |
| **Conditionals** | Assigning grades                                                       |

🎯 Learning Goals

Practice JavaScript fundamentals (arrays, objects, loops, functions)

Understand grading logic with conditionals

Learn mini project structuring for GitHub portfolio


🚀 Future Improvements

🔹 Add user input via prompt/CLI

🔹 Save student data in JSON or database

🔹 Create a simple web interface (HTML + CSS + JS)
